# Additional Analysis of Kickstarter Crowdfunding Campaigns

## Overview of Project
A cient came to us with a desire to initiate a crowdfunding campaign with a $10K budget for a play called "Fever".  The client provided a dataset containing crowdfunding projects for analysis to shwow trends on similiar campaigns to help set the structure for a successful campaign.  Based on the anaylysis of similiar compaigns a recommendation was provided.  The client initiated a crowdfunding campaign for the play "Fever" and it came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, the client wants to understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. 

### Purpose
Generate visualizations for campaign outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) based on their lauch dates and their funding goals.  Present the conclusions drawn and the recomendations for further analysis. 

## Analysis and Challenges
A pivot table filtered based on the theater category and year was generated to created to capture the theater outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) based on launch dates.  Another pivot table was created to capture the relationship of outcomes based on the campaign goals set for the campaigns. Charts were generated to viaually show the theater outcomes based on launch date and the outcomes based on goals in order to present the conclusions from the analysis.  

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
- The summer months are the most popular months to launch new theater campaigns projects based on these months having the highest total of sueccessful and failed campaigns. Theater campaigns lauched in May and June have the highest number of successful campaigns with each month having twice as many successful campaigns as failed campaigns compared to other months.  January has twice the number of cancelations then any other month of the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals? Campaigns with a goal greater than $45,000 fail at least %87.5 of the time.  Campaigns with goals less than $4999 have the highest percentage of successful campaigns. 
-  
- What are some limitations of this dataset?Additional data that would be valuable would be to plot the percentage of successful theater outcomes versus launch data to better visualize the success rate.  Additional data on the number of campaigns per dollar range would be useful to identify any ranges that have limited data which could be plotted on the same chart give more context around the data.    

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create? Some other possible plots to create would be the percentage of successful outcomes versus launch date, outcomes based on the number of backers and donation amount of per backer.
